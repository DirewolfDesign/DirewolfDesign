# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! 

**We're @DirewolfDesign. We're a software and web development company based in the UK. We mostly write small projects and plugins on here that you're more than welcome to fork/contribute to.**

## ðŸ‘€ What we do...

We mostly work directly with web agencies to create bespoke plugins, modules and applications that perform complex tasks in the back-end of websites and apps.
Most commonly we work with third-party API data and incorporate it into WordPress and other CMS systems, but we also work on custom flat-file and markdonw-based website systems.

## ðŸŒ± Current Projects

### [DirewolfBlocks](https://github.com/DirewolfDesign/direwolf-blocks)

Right now we're working on [DirewolfBlocks](https://github.com/DirewolfDesign/direwolf-blocks), a custom block builder and templating system for WordPress blocks.

It's in very early stages of development right now but we're getting there.

Mostly it's an exercise in learning the WordPress Block system a little better so we can do some nicer customisation work in future.

> You're welcome to fork/clone the project and hack away at it yourself!
